# antidote plugins

# With antidote, using Zephyr's completion plugin is recommended. This plugin is meant
# to be run near the TOP of your .zsh_plugins.txt file.

# Use kind:fpath for prompts you want available to promptinit.

# # add even more completions

### Framework: zsh-utils
#
# zsh-utils is a micro-framework that is also well suited to pair with antidote. It
# provides much of the same core functionality from other bigger frameworks without the
# bloat or performance hit. Using zsh-utils, you may find you don't need much else.
# If you want a really thin framework, this is great.
